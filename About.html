            <div class="cap1">
                <p>I'm LD I've lived in Denmark for just over one and a half years. I came here on a whim and havn't looked back. My journey has been full of ups and downs, twist's and turns but honestly now that I am here I couldn't imagine my life anywhere else.</p>
                <P>Prior to turning my life upside down and moving to the big north I lived in Australia. I have a British passport because my father is Welsh and I was born in England but I am a proud aussie and will also call Australia home.</P>

                <p>My career, job and passion back home was working as a Creative Agent for a boutique Creative agency called Hart and Co. I started at Hart and Co. with a fashion backgroud but no agent experience. After 5 years I left an experienced agent and producer.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="cap2">
                <p>Although I struggled to work in Denmark as a Creative Agent I knew that this was where I wanted to be.. I took a job in retail just to get by, however this job became a source of true unhappiness which made life very difficult for 9 months. Luckily after many months of jon hunting I landed a part time job (enough hours to leave my shitty retails job) at a Craft Beer Bar and since then things have really improved for me. I decided to stop obsessing about what wasn’t working and try and approach things from a different perspective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cap3">
                <p>So I decided to look into alternatives ways to break into the job market.
                    This led me to look into courses that would allow me to build upon the experience that I had and take the change to have a degree that would open doors and give me opportunities I wouldn’t otherwise have had. </p>
                <p>I am so thrilled to be at KEA and I think that next two years will be challenging, exciting and Im looking forward to every moment.</p>

            <div class="cap4"><h2>STUDIO A L'ENVERS</h2>

            <p>My intention with this course is to build on the experience that I already have. I started at Hart and Co. with a fashion background but no agent experience. After 5 years I left as an experienced agent and producer. Throughout those 5 years I was exposed to the running of a very busy photographic studio and propping space. Coupled with my exposure to many different fashion and interior stylist’s I developed a love for all things interior, design and creative spaces.</p></div>

            <div class="cap5"><p>I would like to have a beautiful space where I sell curated homwares, as well as having a creative studio space used for small stills shoots. This concept is in it’s early stages but I would call the space Al’envers or Studio Al’envers which in French means Inside Out. In terms of the logo or branding I want it to be very minimal and simple. I love line drawings, their simplicity and also use of negative and positive space. I want to adopt this style into creating a brand that will be strong yet subtle.</p></div>
