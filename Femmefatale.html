                <p>The figure of the “femme fatale,” a French term meaning deadly woman. A femme fatale is an irresistibly beautiful woman who uses her sexuality to seduce men and lure them into dangerous situations to serve her own selfish interests.
                </p>
                <p>They are defined as women of great seductive charm, mysterious, duplicitous, subversive, double-crossing, gorgeous, energized, intelligent, powerful, predatory, tough-sweet, unreliable, irresponsible, manipulative and desperate.
                </p>
                <p>The sexual women’s power and strength of the femme fatale are visually expressed in the films, through the iconography of the image. The femme fatales’ long hair, make-up, jewelry, and cigarettes are symbols of their sensuality. These women are very concerned with slick clothing styles that signify what has been described as “to-be-looked-at-ness”. Their specific make up style and dress code create the image of the sexy, independent and strong femme fatale.

                <p>Urban Dictionary describes a Femme Fatale as; An extremely intelligent, attractive and seductive woman who has a tendency to use man in many ways either for sex, money, help, attention or support.
                    She never falls in love with a man, but rather uses him and takes the advantage that he gives her. Usually her heart is already broken and incapable of love and intimacy because of her dark past and troubling history. She might have loved once and trusted someone but was betrayed and her deceptions of the past left her with irrevocable scars.
                    She is amazing in bed and at all the arts of seduction but she
                    only gives her body never her heart. She has lost all hope in menkind and does no longer believe in happy endings. She learned the hard way: her dark past taught her too well, she’ll never make the same mistake twice.</p>

                <h2>The Ultimate Femme Fatale, The LOVE Goddess Rita Hayworth</h2>

                <p>Rita Hayworth was an american actress and dancer becoming infamous during the 1940’s as the top pin up girl during World war II and dubbed the The Love Goddess.</p>
                <p>Haywworth was best known for her femme fatale role in the 1946 Cinema Noir <cite>GILDA</cite>directed by Charles Vidor. Fred Astaire, with whom she made two films, called her his favorite dance partner. Her greatest success was in the Technicolor musical Cover Girl (1944), with Gene Kelly. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the American Film Institute’s survey, AFI’s 100 Years…100 Stars. In 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, which contributed to her death at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer’s, which was largely unknown by most people at the time, and helped to increase public and private funding for Alzheimer’s research.</p>
