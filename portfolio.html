        <h1>BASIC WEB</h1>
        <div class="nest1">


            <div class="cap1">
                <p>The aim of this theme was to create from scratch a Responsive Website, starting first with a Mobile Website . The website submitted is based on a theme allocated to us. Mine was Cinema Noir, the goal here was research and present information to the ‘user’ about this theme.</p>
                <p>We were introduced to HTML and CSS and Media Queries. Each view port or screen is a different size (mobile phone, ipad, desktop). Each size with it's own breakpoint. By using Media queries we were able to create slightly different styles for each break point. We weretaken through the design process involving; mood boards, style tiles and prototyping. We earned about colour theory, typography, icon design and design principles such as negative and positive space and the Gestalt Law. We also tried the 5 second test with our peers to gather user feedback.</p>

            <div class="cap2">
                <p>What I learned from taking on this process was that by following these design stages; mood board, style tile and XD, it helps you expand and grow your original vision. By the end of this process I realised all of my initial design decisions were ‘too small’ and stylistically really did not work. I ended up changing ALOT and had a completely different website. I did however become more confident with design and the create process, and also learned basic hitml and css.</p>

        <h2>BASIC ANIMATION</h2>

        <div class="nest2">

            <div class="cap1">
                <p>In this theme we learned about ‘ANIMATION’ using a little tool and enemy to many; JAVA SCRIPT. However it wasn’t just animation that was covered in this theme, we also learned about; Story telling, character development and creation, as well as group work.</p>

                <p>We were required to write a story breaking it down into scenes. We had to consider certain creative elements within the story; how the story would become interactive, creating various endings, the story's message, the narrative curve (ie climax, point of no return, highs and lows), character psychology and of course animating the character using a SPRITE sheet.</p><a href="http://ldofficiel.eu/Outforawalk.html">SPRITE LINK</a>

            <div class="cap2">
                <p>The group work involved creating a teaser for a major blockbuster film of our choosing. We created an interactive website as well as a gif. This was a more 'production' heavy assignment. We were free to record sound, create elaborate backgrounds and expand on our character creations. We were encouraged to use platforms like Github for our work and methods such as SCRUM to manage ourselves as a team. The group work highlighted my strengths which are communication, organisation and presenting. Gea and I worked on all documentation and presented our final assigment.</p><a href="http://tiffvoli.com/week_14_monty/">02.04.06 MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL</a>

        <h3>BASIC CONTENT</h3>

        <div class="nest3">

            <div class="cap1">
                <p>Theme three was all about CONTENT. We worked in two groups to submit two projects both with content we created, filmed and produced ourselves.
                    We were introduced to Premiere Pro, production elements such as Film Language, Style Guides and Writing Treatments.
                    We utilised skills we had already learned in Themes 1 and 2 including wireframes, XD prototyping, story boards, mood boards, coding - HTML, CSS and JS, sound recording and video editing.</p>

            <div class="img2"><img src="http://ldofficiel.eu/THEME3STORYBOARD.png" alt="story3" width=378></div>

            <div class="cap2">
                <p>The first project was a short video on a subject of our choice but the video wasn’t allowed to include any dialog. We were supposed to use music, body language, filming techniques to successfully communicate the subject.
                    The second project was a much bigger production. Armed with no restrictions our aim was to film a council sponsored video about cycling rules in Denmark, aimed at tourist’s and expats (non-canes). We also had to design a webpage that supported the video, a webpage that would supply more information about cycling and would not outshine but simple act as a platform for the video.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cap3">
                <p>We had to consider the user, our target audience. Who is our target market and how can we design a webpage and shoot a video that directly identifies and reaches this audience.
                    Content, colour, design all played a part in successful reaching our target audience. We used a number of methods for user testing including peer review, 5 second test, Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics.</p><a href="http://zachery.dk/microsite/">03.02.05 BKE/CPH</a>

        <h4>BASIC UX</h4>

        <div class="nest4">

            <div class="cap1">
                <p>The final theme for this semester was Basic UX. Unfortunately I suffered a significant injury to my knee which meant I was absent for most of this theme. I did however study the teaching material on FRONTER as well as gather my own findings on google. Design Sprints can be very in depth and with alot of the therory available quite dry I found many videos online easy to follow, which broke down the SPRINT process is a very simple way. So I made my own Storyboard about the SPRINT 5-day process.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="cap2">
                <p>
                    SO WHATS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT?! Design Sprints were developed to help solve problems and test new ideas plan. This can apply to almost anything, Whether you are designing a new website or selling underwear. You have a starting point be it your customer, design team or end users. You then have an end goal. You have steps that take you from your starting point to your end goal. Here's a very simple breakdown of what a Design Sprints in spanning 5 days.This was the same process progression that we learned in class.

            <div class="img1"><iframe width="500" height="300"src="http://ldofficiel.eu/designsprint1.pdf" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

            <div class="cap3">
                <p>Since the SPRINT book was released in 2016 there have been some updates to the process. According to AJandSamrt the 5-day Sprint is now the 4-day sprint. Here's how the process has changed a little.
                    Monday consists of the same planning or mapping stage, as well as the sketching stage.
                    Tuesday will have the solution pitch and storyboard stage.
                    Wednesday will be all about prototyping.
                    Thursday concludes the interviews and testing.
                    Each day is split into morning and afternoon sessions which cuts the time for some stages done by half so for example, the book requires you to spend a day planning but the new process allows a quick 45 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cap4">
                <p>During this theme we learned not just about Design Sprints but we worked with team canvass, one on one interviews, user tests, prototyping, coding of mobile first websites with javascript, problem solving through design sprint and group work methods - dot voting. Although I missed the 5 day sprint I belive that the previous work we did during theme one and two allowed me to feel confident in the areas. If we need to work again with design sprints, user research, test and pitching I feel I could excute these skills.</p>
